 - `MODS`: Number of the users who should be the admins of the bot (should be in international format without "+" and multiple numbers must be separated by a comma ", ")
 - `SESSION`: Session of the bot
5. Wait for the building to finish, you should always keep an eye on log messages, you can find log messages in the Dashboard -> More -> View logs.<br>
6. After it builds, click on the "View" or "Open App".<br>
7. Authenticate By going to http://your_app_name/qr/your_session>.<br>
